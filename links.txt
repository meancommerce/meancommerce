First you must install NodeJS.
Open the command prompt to run following commands.
Windows 7: Open Start and write cmd into the search and press enter.
Windows XP: Open Start and select Run and write cmd and press enter.
Run this command to install a HTTP server: npm install http-server -g
And start the HTTP server: http-server /path/to/docroot with a path to the folder you want to share. Your folder must have some files before it works.
Now just open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
